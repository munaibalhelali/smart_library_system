# smart_library_system

## To compile the code:
You can run the run.sh file to build and execute the system automatically or do it manually as follows:

- Create a build directory and move into it:
    
   ```sh
        mkdir build
        cd build
   ``` 

- In build run cmake and build:
    ```sh 
        cmake ..
        build 
    ```

- The resulting executable will be in the build directory:
    ```sh 
        ./smart_library_system
    ```
